# NNDb-3T+: A neuroimaging database combining movie-watching and eye-tracking in teenagers.

## Overview
The dataset is designed to support research into brain function during naturalistic conditions. Data were acquired at 3T, complemented by physiological and behavioral measures.
Before their visit, participants (N=40) filled out questionnaires about demographic information, language background, mental health and emotion regulation. Participants also completed a set of cognitive tests and Ecological Momentary Assessments over the course of two weeks.
During Session 1, the participant watched the entirety of 'Back To The Future' (backtothefuture), divided into three parts. Eye-tracker calibration was performed before each part. The entire process for Session 1 took about three hours.

## Data Organization
The dataset follows the BIDS specification:
- `sub-<participant_id>` directories contain session-level raw data.
- `sourcedata/` includes raw files of eye-tracker (in asc and edf) and pulse oximetry (in tsv) data.
- `derivatives/` include preprocessing outputs.

## Contents
- **fMRI data**: Preprocessed and raw fMRI from movie-watching.
- **Eye-tracking**: Calibrated gaze and pupil data synchronized with fMRI during movie-wathing and retinotopy tasks.
- **Physiological recordings**: Pulse oximetry.
- **Behavioral and cognitive assessments**: Demographic and psychometric data.
- **Derivatives**: Preprocessed files including Freesurfer and AFNI outputs.

All preprocessing scripts and analysis code are available on GitHub:
